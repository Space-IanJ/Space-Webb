        <h2 align = "left" class = font1 id = color1> How did our <u>Universe</u> form?</h2>
        <p align = "justify" class = font1>Our universe began with an <u>explosion</u> of space itself - the Big Bang. It formed 
        <u>13.8</u> billion years ago. Starting from extremely high density and temperature, space expanded, the universe cooled,
         and the simplest elements formed. <u>Gravity</u> gradually drew matter together to form the first stars and the first galaxies.
         Galaxies collected into groups, clusters, and <u>superclusters</u>. Some stars died in supernova <u>explosions</u>, whose chemical 
         remnants seeded new generations of stars and enabled the formation of rocky planets. On at least 
         one such planet, life evolved to consciousness. And it wonders, “Where did I come from?” But it cannot be that
         earth is the only planet with life! Just Imagine the 100's of 1000's of galaxies having 1000's of stars
         having 100's of planets... at least one of them, can have life? And we have already discovered few planets with life!
         for example: Trappsit 1-B, Kebller 22C, and more!</p>

         <h2 align = "left" class = font1 id = color1> How did our <u>Solar System</u> form?</h2>
         <p align = "justify" class = font1> The Sun and the planets formed together, 4.6 billion years ago, 
        from a cloud of gas and dust called the solar nebula.A shock wave from a nearby supernova explosion
        probably initiated the collapse of the solar nebula. The Sun formed in the center of the solar system, 
        and the planets formed in a thin disk orbiting around it. These thin dics cointain <u>molten rocks </u>
        which collided with each other to form the planets that orbited the sun. This is how the solar system formed.
        The first planet to form was Jupiter, next was saturn, then came the <u>3</u> ice giants... wait 3 ice giants!? 
        You may be wondering, how are there 3 ice giants? Well at the beggening the solar system had 20 PLANETS! 
        Why we only have 8 right now is because most of the planets were destroyed in collisions. Some also escaped the 
        system. We will discuss this more deeeper in the next chapters.</p>

        <h2 align = "left" class = font1 id = color1> How did our <u>Moon</u> form?</h2>
        <p align = "justify" class = font1>
        Our Moon formed due to a collision that happened long ago with Earth, about <u>4 BYA</u>.
         Earth had collided with a mars sized body called <u>Theia</u>. Both the cellestial bodies
         used to share ALMOST the same orbit. One day, both the planet came together, and collided.
         Trillions of molten rock was ejected into an orbit around Earth. Theia was destroyed luckily,
         Earth was able to hold most of its mass to still be a planet. The rocks that were ejected started colliding
         with each other becoming bigger and bigger, and as gravity grew, more rocks came together.
         Gravity was strong enough to make the surface smooth and round to form our <u>Moon</u> that
         we know today. We believe that one huge crater collided at the bottom to create the South Basin.
         Other few craters during LHB (Late Heavy Bombardment) could have opened up magma resevoirs to seep
         throught the surface, after it colled it would have created dark spots which formed the Sea of Tranquility,
         and the Sea of Serenity. Other small craters could have crashed as well. Mercury, and Uranus also had impacts
        like Earth. Mercury could have got a moon like earth except its low gravity could not capture the rocks.</p>

        Earth's Atmosphere is made our several different gases. The major gases comprise of <u>Nitrogen</u>
         which makes up 78% of Earth's Atmosphere. <u>Oxygen</u> comprises of 21% of the Atmosphere. 0.9%
         of <u>Argon</u>, and the rest 0.1% are other gases, like: Carbon-dioxide, Methane, Water Vapor,
         and Neon comprise of the 0.1% remaining.

         Here is a list showing the elements in the Atmosphere:

        <h2 align="left" class="font1" id="color1">The <u>Dwarf Planets</u> in our Solar System</h2>
        <p align="justify" class="font1">
        There are 5 main Dwarf Planets in the Solar System. Before these 5 were called planets, but after further observation, we found out that Dwarf
         Planets only consider 2/3 thing <u>Important</u> to be considered a planet. The three thing to be a planet is that: 1. The object has have enough
         gravity to be round, 2. The object has to orbit a star, 3. The object should clear their neighborhood. Now the Dwarf Planets, <u>don't</u> clear their
         neighborhood, they are either in the asteriod belt or kuiper belt. These Dwarf planets orbits have an inclination, or deformed. This is why These
         objects are in the Dwarf Planets Category.
        <br/>
        <p align="justify" class="font1">These are the Dwarf Planets in the Solar System:</p>
        <br/>
        <ol>
        <li align="justify" class="font1">Pluto - Largest Dwarf Planet, in the kuiper belt, Pluto has a moon 1/2 its size, making pluto orbit it, Its name is Charon.</li>
        <br/>
        <li align="justify" class="font1">Eris - Second Largest Dwarf Planet, but the heavist one, in the kuiper belt, most complex orbit, called as Pluto's brother.</li>
        <br/>
        <li align="justify" class="font1">Haumea - One of the fastest spinning objects, Has an Oval Shape due to its speed of rotation - 4 hours, it has thin rings and Two Moons.</li>
        <br/>
        <li align="justify" class="font1">MakeMake - Take 305 Earth years to Orbit the Sun, its rotation is 22 1/2 Hours. Right above Neptune's Orbit</li>
        <br/>
        <li align="justify" class="font1">Ceres - Smallest Dwarf planet, and the largest asteroid, Located in the Asteroid belt between mars and juptier.</li>
        <br/>
        <p align="justify" class="font1"> These are the 5 main Dwarf Planets, but there are a few smaller ones like Sedna, and 4 Vesta.</p>
